// TODO 1: Create a class DrinksCubit and extend it with Cubit
// TODO 2: Initialize it with the first state

// TODO 5.1: Add a getter method to the DrinksCubit that returns only selectedDrinks
// This is a HotFix so it is not part of the video the solution can
// be found in the solution branch. The solution in the video will work
// but this solution is way better ;)

// TODO 6: Write a method inside the DrinksCubit that selects a drink

// TODO Optional: Override the onTransition Method to see how your cubit changes
